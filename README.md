Some backgrounds about DFS (Depth First Search):
Unlike BFS (Breadth First Search), DFS will traverse each kid throughly before move to the next kid. 
Order you traverse each kid doesn't matter. For example, you can start traversing from left kid or right kid, but once you decide which side to start, you need to keep consistency.
